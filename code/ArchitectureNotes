techniques for performing service discovery on AWS for microservices-based architectures are explored.

Amazon ECS now includes integrated service discovery that makes it easy for your containerized services to discover and connect with each other.
you had to configure and run your own service discovery system based on Amazon Route 53, AWS Lambda, and ECS Event Stream, or connect every service to a load balancer.
Amazon ECS creates and manages a registry of service names using the Route 53 Auto Naming API
In addition, you can also use unified service discovery for services managed by Kubernetes.
